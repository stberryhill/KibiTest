# KibiTest
A minimal, single-header C89 testing framework in under a Kibibyte.

* There are three functions: Kibi_Test, Kibi_AssertTrue, and Kibi_AssertFalse.
* Simply pass the desired test function into Kibi_Test (it must have no parameters).
* Just include the header file and you're good to go, no linking necessary.
